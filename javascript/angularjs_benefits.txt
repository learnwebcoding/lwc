AngularJS Benefits

1.) Eliminate JS event registration (ng-click).
2.) Eliminate HTML repetitive table row code and JS for loops (ng-repeat).
3.) Eliminate HTML id attributes and JS getElementById() method (ng-model and angular data binding).
4.) Eliminate JS returning boolean value.
5.) Eliminates JS form validation routine.
6.) Eliminates need to explicitly get and set form values on form object properties in order to save and use them later. Instead, they are implicitly/automatically saved to ng-model directive properties.
7.) Eliminate JS as means to apply logic for the display of HTML content (ng-show). Eliminate conditional based HTML from JS.
8.) Eliminate JS have to get/set values on properties (ng-model). Eliminates having to use JS getElementById() method to get form element values, and having to explicitly set the values on JS properties.
9.) Reduces comments as the AngularJS syntax is self explanatory.
10.) Eliminates JS need to explicitly send form off for validation.
11.) Eliminates HTML id attribute references by using AngularJS data binding.
12.) AngularJS directly references forms via form name attribute and form element name attributes, not form id attribute and form element id attributes.
13.) Less likely need to pass event object.
