https://blog.learnwebcoding.com/?p=18

Apparently Chrome 50.0 is the first version of Chrome that no longer supports Windows XP/Vista and Mac OS X 10.6 - 10.8 per the following Chrome Blog announcement back on 10 Nov 2015.

For additional information, see:

Updates to Chrome platform support - Tuesday, November 10, 2015:

Interestingly, the announcement states that Microsoft no longer supports Windows Vista, which is not true as Windows Vista Extended Support does not end until 11 Apr 2017.
