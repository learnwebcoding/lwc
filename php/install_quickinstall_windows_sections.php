     <h2><a id='introduction'></a>1. Introduction</h2>

     <p>One solution for developing phpBB board styles locally requires a web server (including PHP interpreter), a SQL database server, and phpBB3 QuickInstall (QuickInstall). QuickInstall manages the installation of phpBB boards on the web server and SQL database server. The installed phpBB boards are fully functional: you can post, reply, login, access the User Control Panel, access the Administration Control Panel, create categories, create forums, create users, create groups, set permissions, etc. In addition, you can create any number of phpBB boards, including multiple instances of the same version of a phpBB board software. Moreover, you can install and develop any number of phpBB board styles on the phpBB boards.</p>

     <div class='note normal'>
      <ul>
       <li>In this example:
        <ul>
         <li>The web server (including PHP interpreter) and SQL database server are provided by <a href='https://www.apachefriends.org/'>Apache Friends XAMPP (apachefriends.org)</a>.</li>
         <li>The XAMPP web server is Apache HTTP Server (Apache) and the XAMPP SQL database server is MySQL.

          <div class='note normal'>Actually, the XAMPP SQL database server is MariaDB, which is developed by the MariaDB Foundation, not MySQL, which is developed by Oracle. MariaDB is a drop in place replacement for MySQL. Therefore, for most practical purposes, the terms <q>MariaDB</q> and <q>MySQL</q> are interchangeable. In this example, <q>MySQL</q> is used throughout.</div>

Although the installation and setup of the phpBB board software by the Softaculous and Bitnami products is more automated/less manual compared to QuickInstall; the Softaculous and Bitnami products share one downside: when a new version of the phpBB board software is released, it can take up to two days for Softaculous, and up to four weeks for Bitnami, to build the new version of the phpBB board software into their products. In this example, new versions of the phpBB board software and phpBB board styles, including release candidates, can be installed as soon as they are released.</li>

     <h2><a id='installQuickInstall'></a>2. Install phpBB3 QuickInstall</h2>

     <p>QuickInstall requires a web server (including PHP interpreter) and a SQL database server. The supported SQL database servers are <a href='https://www.mysql.com/'>MySQL (mysql.com)</a>, <a href='https://www.postgresql.org/'>PostgreSQL (postgresql.org)</a>, <a href='https://www.sqlite.org/'>SQLite (sqlite.org)</a>, and <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2016'>MS SQL (microsoft.com)</a>.</p>

     <p>QuickInstall software refers to the files that constitute QuickInstall. The files that constitute QuickInstall are located in the QuickInstall software folder.</p>

     <p>QuickInstall software is installed on the web server. QuickInstall software is installed by simply copying the QuickInstall software folder to the root of the web server.</p>

     <p>To install QuickInstall:</p>

     <ol>
      <li>Download the source code (zip) file for the latest official version, not release candidate (RC) version, of QuickInstall from <a href='https://github.com/phpbb/quickinstall/releases'>GitHub phpBB QuickInstall Releases (github.com)</a>. In this example, the source code (zip) file for QuickInstall 1.3.1 was downloaded.</li>
      <li>Extract the downloaded file. In this example, the downloaded <span class='filename'>quickinstall-1.3.1.zip</span> file was extracted to the <span class='filename'>quickinstall-1.3.1</span> folder.</li>
      <li>For consistency, rename the QuickInstall software folder to <span class='filename'>quickinstall</span>. In this example, the <span class='filename'>quickinstall-1.3.1</span> folder was renamed <span class='filename'>quickinstall</span>.</li>
      <li>Copy the <span class='filename'>quickinstall</span> QuickInstall software folder to the root of the web server. In this example, the <span class='filename'>quickinstall</span> QuickInstall software folder was copied to the root of XAMPP Apache as <span class='filename'>C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\quickinstall</span>.</li>
      <li>The QuickInstall software is installed.</li>

     <h2><a id='installBoardSoftware'></a>3. Install phpBB Board Software</h2>

     <p>phpBB board software refers to the files that constitute a phpBB board. The files that constitute a phpBB board are located in a phpBB board software folder.</p>

     <p>phpBB board software is installed on QuickInstall. Multiple phpBB board software can be installed. phpBB board software is installed by simply copying the phpBB board software folder to the correct QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources</span> directory. The first phpBB board software to install is copied to the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources</span> directory. Subsequent phpBB board software to install is copied to the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources\phpBB3_alt</span> directory.</p>

     <p>The installed phpBB board software serves as source files for the creation of phpBB boards. QuickInstall 1.3.x supports phpBB 3.0.x, 3.1.x, and 3.2.x board software.</p>

     <h3><a id='installFirstBoardSoftware'></a>3.1. Install The First phpBB Board Software To The QuickInstall Software <span class='filename'>sources</span> Directory</h3>

     <p>When QuickInstall is run, if it does not find a phpBB board software folder named <span class='filename'>phpBB3</span> in the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources</span> directory, it errors and cannot proceed. Therefore, the first phpBB board software to install must be a <span class='filename'>phpBB3</span> phpBB board software folder copied to the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources</span> directory.</p>

     <p>To install the first phpBB board software to the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources</span> directory:</p>

     <ol>
      <li>Download phpBB board software from <a href='https://www.phpbb.com/downloads/'>phpBB Downloads (phpbb.com)</a>. In this example, phpBB 3.2.1 was downloaded.</li>
      <li>Extract the downloaded file. In this example, the downloaded <span class='filename'>phpBB-3.2.1.zip</span> file was extracted to the <span class='filename'>phpBB3</span> folder.</li>
      <li>Copy the <span class='filename'>phpBB3</span> phpBB board software folder to the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources</span> directory. In this example, the <span class='filename'>phpBB3</span> phpBB board software folder was copied to the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources</span> directory as <span class='filename'>C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\quickinstall\\sources\\phpBB3</span>.</li>
      <li>The first phpBB board software is installed.</li>
     </ol>

     <h3><a id='installSubsequentBoardSoftware'></a>3.2. Install Subsequent phpBB Board Software To The QuickInstall Software <span class='filename'>sources\phpBB3_alt</span> Directory</h3>

     <p>The installation of subsequent phpBB board software differs from the installation of the first phpBB board software in the following ways:</p>

     <ul>
      <li>Subsequent phpBB board software is installed by copying the phpBB board software folder to the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources\phpBB3_alt</span> directory, not the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources</span> directory.</li>
      <li>Subsequent phpBB board software folders do not have to be named <span class='filename'>phpBB3</span>.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>To install subsequent phpBB board software to the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources\phpBB3_alt</span> directory:</p>

     <ol>
      <li>Download phpBB board software from <a href='https://www.phpbb.com/downloads/'>phpBB Downloads (phpbb.com)</a> In this example, phpBB 3.1.11 was downloaded.</li>
      <li>Extract the downloaded file. In this example, the downloaded <span class='filename'>phpBB-3.1.11.zip</span> file was extracted to the <span class='filename'>phpBB3</span> folder.</li>
      <li><a id='subsequentPhpbbBoardSoftwareFolderName'></a>Rename the <span class='filename'>phpBB3</span> phpBB board software folder to something unique and descriptive about the phpBB board software. In this example, the <span class='filename'>phpBB3</span> folder was renamed <span class='filename'>phpBB3_3111</span>.</li>
      <li>Copy the phpBB board software folder to the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources\phpBB3_alt</span> directory. In this example, the <span class='filename'>phpBB3_3111</span> phpBB board software folder was copied to the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources\phpBB3_alt</span> directory as <span class='filename'>C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\quickinstall\\sources\\phpBB3_alt\\phpBB3_3111</span>.</li>
      <li>The subsequent phpBB board software is installed.</li>

     <h2><a id='createQuickInstallProfiles'></a>4. Create QuickInstall Profiles</h2>

     <p>Before a phpBB board can be created, at least one QuickInstall profile must be created. A QuickInstall profile stores default phpBB board settings that are to be applied to the created phpBB boards. Multiple QuickInstall profiles can be created. QuickInstall is run in a web browser.</p>

     <p>QuickInstall profiles are created in the QuickInstall Profiles tab. By default, the first time QuickInstall is run, and every time QuickInstall is run without creating a QuickInstall profile, the QuickInstall Profiles tab is selected.</p>

     <p>To create a QuickInstall profile:</p>

     <ol>
      <li>Start the web server and SQL database server. In this example, XAMPP Apache and MySQL were started.</li>
      <li>Point the web browser to QuickInstall. In this example, QuickInstall is http://localhost/quickinstall/.</li>
      <li>The QuickInstall <b>Profiles</b> tab is selected:
       <img src='/images/install_quickinstall_windows/qi_profiles_tab_800x260.gif' alt='phpBB3 QuickInstall Profiles Tab' class='box-shadow' />
      </li>
      <li>Go to the Database settings fieldset.
       <ol>
        <li>Database type selects the installed SQL database server to use. If MySQL 4.1.3 or later is installed, it is recommended that MySQLi (MySQL improved), not MySQL, is selected.
         <ul>
          <li>In the Database type dropdown, use the default (MySQLi) or select a different installed SQL database server. In this example, <kbd>MySQLi</kbd> was selected.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Database username/password refers to the username/password of a SQL database server user account with permissions to create databases.
         <ol>
          <li>In the Database username field, enter the username of a SQL database user account with permissions to create databases. In this example, <kbd>root</kbd> (the MySQL root user account username) was entered.</li>
          <li>In the Database password field, enter the password of the SQL database user account or check No password. In this example, <kbd>No password</kbd> (the MySQL root user account default password) was checked.</li>
         </ol>
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Go to the Time settings fieldset. Time zone sets the default time zone.
       <ul>
        <li>In the Time zone dropdown, select the time zone for your location. In this example, <kbd>America/New York</kbd> was selected.</li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a id='createQuickInstallProfiles_administratorUsernamePassword'></a>Go to the Admin settings fieldset. Administrator username/password assigns a username/password to the phpBB board Administrator account. The phpBB board Administrator account has access to the phpBB board Administration Control Panel (ACP).
       <ol>
        <li>In the Administrator username field, use the default (admin) or enter a different username. In this example, <kbd>admin</kbd> was entered.</li>
        <li>In the Administrator password field, enter a password. In this example, <kbd>adminPass</kbd> was entered.</li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Go to the Misc settings fieldset.
       <ol>
        <li>Alternate environment selects the installed phpBB board software to use as source files for the creation of the phpBB board. If only one phpBB board software is installed, the Alternate environment dropdown has one option. If multiple phpBB board software are installed, the Alternate environment dropdown has multiple options. In either case, the Default environment (latest phpBB) option always refers to the phpBB board software installed to the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources</span> directory. Whether or not it is the <q>latest phpBB</q> is never actually determined and, therefore, could be incorrect. Subsequent phpBB board software installed to the QuickInstall software <span class='filename'>sources\phpBB3_alt</span> directory are listed in the Alternate environment dropdown by their <a href='#subsequentPhpbbBoardSoftwareFolderName'>phpBB board software folder name (above)</a>.

         </ul>
        </li>
        <li>autoMOD refers to phpBB 3.0.x board software modifications known as MODs. Unless you are a developer or user of MODs, to avoid the <q>AutoMOD not found in the <span class='filename'>sources</span> directory</q> error that appears when using installed phpBB 3.0.x board software as source files for the creation of phpBB boards, it is recommended that <kbd>No</kbd> is selected.
         <ul>
          <li>In the autoMOD radio button group, use the default (Yes) or select No. In this example, <kbd>No</kbd> was selected.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Go to the Save settings fieldset. Save as new profile assigns a name to the QuickInstall profile. If left empty/blank, <q>default</q> is automatically assigned. If an existing QuickInstall profile name is entered, the QuickInstall profile settings are overwritten.
       <ul>
        <li>In the Save as new profile field, use the default (empty/blank) or enter a QuickInstall profile name. In this example, <kbd>myProfile</kbd> was entered.</li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For all of the other settings, use the default.</li>
      <li>Click <kbd>Save</kbd>.</li>
      <li>The <q>Your settings were successfully saved</q> report appears and the QuickInstall Boards tab appears to the left of the QuickInstall Profiles tab. If the QuickInstall Boards tab does not appear, press <kbd>F5</kbd> or click <kbd>Refresh/Reload</kbd>.</li>

     <h2><a id='createBoards'></a>5. Create phpBB Boards</h2>

     <p>After a QuickInstall profile is created, phpBB boards can be created. A phpBB board is a functional implementation of the phpBB board software.</p>

     <p>phpBB boards are created in the QuickInstall Boards tab. At the top of the QuickInstall Boards tab, a QuickInstall profile is selected. Some of the QuickInstall profile settings become the defaults in, and can be changed in, the QuickInstall Boards tab. One worth noting is Alternate environment, which  selects the installed phpBB board software to use as source files for the creation of the phpBB board.</p>

     <p>When a pbpBB board is created, the phpBB board software source files are copied from the QuickInstall <span class='filename'>sources</span> or <span class='filename'>sources\phpBB3_alt</span> directory to the QuickInstall <span class='filename'>boards</span> directory. The phpBB board software source files are not changed during this process, and, therefore, can serve repeatedly as original phpBB board software source files.</p>

     <p>To create phpBB boards:</p>

     <ol>
      <li>Start the web server and SQL database server. In this example, XAMPP Apache and MySQL were started.</li>
      <li>Point the web browser to QuickInstall. In this example, QuickInstall is http://localhost/quickinstall/.</li>

      </li>
      <li>Go to the Profiles fieldset. Current profile selects the QuickInstall profile whose settings will be incorporated into the phpBB board.
       <ul>
        <li>For Current profile:
         <ul>
          <li>If only one QuickInstall profile is created, the QuickInstall profile is listed as selected and there is nothing to do. Go to the next step. In this example, only one QuickInstall profile is created, it is listed as selected, and there is nothing to do. Go to the next step.</li>

       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Go to the Options fieldset.

     <h2><a id='installStyles'></a>6. Install phpBB Board Styles</h2>

     <p>A phpBB board style determines the look/appearance of a phpBB board. phpBB board style software refers to the files that constitute a phpBB board style. The files that constitute a phpBB board style are located in a phpBB board style software folder.</p>

     <p>phpBB board style software is installed on phpBB board software as phpBB board styles. Multiple phpBB board styles can be installed and each phpBB board has its own installed phpBB board style(s).</p>

     <p>phpBB board software includes one or more phpBB board styles with one of the phpBB board styles pre-configured as the phpBB board default style. More specifically, phpBB 3.0.x includes the phpBB prosilver 3.0.x board style and the subsilver2 3.0.x board style, with prosilver 3.0.x pre-configured as the phpBB board default style. phpBB 3.1.x includes the phpBB prosilver 3.1.x board style, which is pre-configured as the phpBB board default style. phpBB 3.2.x includes the phpBB prosilver 3.2.x board style, which is pre-configured as the phpBB board default style.</p>

     <p>phpBB 3.0.x boards support phpBB 3.0.x board styles. phpBB 3.1.x boards support phpBB 3.1.x board styles. phpBB 3.2.x boards support phpBB 3.2.x board styles.</p>

     <p>Some phpBB board styles are standalone styles and some are child styles. A standalone style is a fully developed/complete style that has no dependencies. The phpBB board default style, prosilver, is an example of a standalone style.</p>

     <p>Developing standalone styles from scratch is difficult. So, instead of developing standalone styles from scratch, most phpBB style developers take an existing standalone style and modify it to their liking. There are two practical ways of doing this. First, edit the standalone style directly, thereby creating a fork/branch of the original standalone style. Second, do not edit the standalone style at all. Instead, create a separate phpBB board style that overlays/modifies the standalone style with the changes you would like to make. Here, the unmodified standalone style is known as the parent style, and the separate style that overlays/modifies the parent style is known as the child style. In this type of style relationship, the child style inherits the style of the parent style, and, therefore, the child style only needs to specify the changes to the parent style that you would like to make. As a result, however, the child style is only a partially developed/incomplete style that is dependent on the parent style. This means the use of a child style requires; 1.) installation of both the child style and the parent style, and 2.) that the child style, not the parent style, is selected as the phpBB board default style.</p>

     <p>prosilver Second Edition is an example of a child style. prosilver Special Edition is a child style of the phpBB standalone prosilver style. In other words, prosilver is the parent style of the prosilver Second Edition child style. When prosilver and prosilver Special Edition are installed and prosilver is selected as the phpBB board default style, prosilver functions as a standalone style. When prosilver and prosilver Special Edition are installed and prosilver Special Edition is selected as the phpBB board default style, prosilver functions as a parent style.</p>

     <p>Installing phpBB board styles is a two step process:</p>

     <ol>
      <li>Copy the phpBB board style software to the phpBB board software <span class='filename'>styles</span> directory.</li>
      <li>Install the phpBB board style via the phpBB board software Administration Control Panel (ACP).</li>
     </ol>

     <h3><a id='copyStyleSoftware'></a>6.1. Copy phpBB Board Style Software To The phpBB Board Software <span class='filename'>styles</span> Directory</h3>

     <p>The first step to installing phpBB board styles is to copy the phpBB board style software to the phpBB board software <span class='filename'>styles</span> directory. This makes the phpBB board styles available to the phpBB board software Administration Control Panel (ACP) for installation.</p>

     <p>To copy phpBB board style software to the phpBB board software <span class='filename'>styles</span> directory:</p>

     <ol>
      <li>Download the phpBB board style software from <a href='https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/styles/board_styles-12'>phpBB Board Styles (phpbb.com)</a>. If the phpBB board style is a child style and the parent style is not already installed on the phpBB board software, also download the parent style. In this example, the <a href='https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/style/prosilver_special_edition/'>phpBB prosilver Special Edition 3.2.1 (phpbb.com)</a> style was downloaded. prosilver Special Edition 3.2.1 is a child style of prosilver 3.2.1. prosilver 3.2.1 is the phpBB 3.2.1 default style and, therefore, is already installed on phpBB 3.2.1. As a result, in this example, there is no need to download a parent style.</li>
      <li>Extract the downloaded file(s). In this example, the downloaded <span class='filename'>prosilver_se_3.2.1.zip</span> file was extracted to the <span class='filename'>prosilver_se</span> folder.</li>
      <li>Copy the phpBB board style software folder(s) to the phpBB board software <span class='filename'>styles</span> directory. In this example, the <span class='filename'>prosilver_se</span> phpBB board style software folder was copied to the phpBB board software <span class='filename'>styles</span> directory as <span class='filename'>C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\quickinstall\\boards\\phpbb321\\styles\\prosilver_se</span>. As a result of the copy, the phpBB board software <span class='filename'>styles</span> directory contains the prosilver parent style (<span class='filename'>prosilver</span>) and the prosilver Special Edition child style (<span class='filename'>prosilver_se</span>):
       <img src='/images/install_quickinstall_windows/prosilver_se_copied_to_board_software_styles_directory_570x603.gif' alt='prosilver Special Edition Copied To phpBB Board Software styles Directory' />
       <div class='note normal'>The phpBB 3.2.x board software <span class='filename'>styles\all</span> directory is not a phpBB board style software folder and can be ignored.</div>
      </li>
     </ol>

     <h3><a id='installStylesSubsec'></a>6.2. Install phpBB Board Styles</h3>

     <p>The second step to installing phpBB board styles is to formally install them. Installing phpBB board styles does two things:</p>

     <ul>
      <li>Lists the phpBB board styles in the phpBB board Administration Control Panel (ACP) | Customise | Style Management - Styles page.</li>
      <li>Activates the phpBB board styles. This lists the phpBB board styles as available options for selection as the phpBB board default style in all user contexts.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>To install phpBB board styles:</p>

     <ol>
      <li>Start the web server and SQL database server. In this example, XAMPP Apache and MySQL were started.</li>
      <li>Point the web browser to the phpBB board. In this example, the phpBB board is http://localhost/quickinstall/boards/phpbb321/.</li>
      <li>Login to the Administration Control Panel (ACP) as the phpBB board Administrator:
       <ol>
        <li>Click <kbd>Login</kbd> in the board header. Login using the Administrator username/password entered in <a href='#createQuickInstallProfiles_administratorUsernamePassword'>Administrator username/password (above)</a>. In this example, the <kbd>admin</kbd> username and <kbd>adminPass</kbd> password were entered.</li>
        <li>Click <kbd>ACP</kbd> in the board header or <kbd>Administration Control Panel</kbd> at the bottom of the board. Login again using the Administrator username/password. In this example, the <kbd>admin</kbd> username and <kbd>adminPass</kbd> password were entered.</li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Upon logging into the ACP as the phpBB board Administrator, the <b>General</b> tab is selected:
       <div class='note normal'>In this example, upon logging into the ACP as the phpBB board Administrator, the ACP displays the following message: <q>Your config file (<span class='filename'>config.php</span>) is currently world-writable. We strongly encourage you to change the permissions to 640 or at least to 644 (for example: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod'>chmod</a> 640 <span class='filename'>config.php</span>).</q> In this example, the XAMPP host computer operating system is Windows, not Linux. In this example, by default; 1.) the Users group does not have write permissions to the phpBB board <span class='filename'>config.php</span> file, and 2.) the phpBB board <span class='filename'>config.php</span> file is not readable by the web browser. In this example, normal Windows file sharing and file system permissions apply to the phpBB board <span class='filename'>config.php</span> file. Further discussion of Windows and/or Linux file system permissions is beyond the scope of this web page.</div>
      </li>
      <li>Click the <kbd>Customise</kbd> tab.</li>
      <li>The <b>Customise</b> web page appears. In the left sidebar under Style Management, click <kbd>Styles</kbd>.</li>
      <li>The <b>Styles</b> web page appears. Styles lists the installed phpBB board styles. In this example, the phpBB board default style, prosilver, is installed:
       <img src='/images/install_quickinstall_windows/apc_styles_prosilver_installed_783x323.gif' alt='prosilver Style Installed' class='box-shadow' />
      </li>
      <li>In the left sidebar under Style Management, click <kbd>Install Styles</kbd>.</li>
      <li>The <b>Install styles</b> web page appears. Install styles lists the phpBB board styles that have been copied to the phpBB board software <span class='filename'>styles</span> directory, but have not been installed. For example, if a child style is listed and its parent style is not installed, the child style cannot be installed and it reports the required parent style. If the parent style is also listed, the child style is listed indented and underneath its parent style:
       <img src='/images/install_quickinstall_windows/apc_install_styles_parent_listed_not_installed_783x370.gif' alt='Child And Parent Styles Copied But Not Installed' class='box-shadow' />
       If a child style is listed and its parent style is installed, the child style can be installed. In other words, when installing parent and child styles, the parent style must be installed first. In this example, because prosilver is already installed, prosilver is not listed and the copied prosilver Special Edition child style is ready to be installed:
       <img src='/images/install_quickinstall_windows/apc_install_styles_prosilver_se_listed_783x320.gif' alt='prosilver Special Edition Child Style Ready To Be Installed' class='box-shadow' />
      </li>
      <li>Under Actions, click <kbd>Install style</kbd>.</li>
      <li>The <q>Information: Style <q>style name</q> has been installed.</q> report appears. In this example, the <q>Information: Style <q>prosilver Special Edition</q>; has been installed.</q> report appears.</li>
      <li>The phpBB board style is installed.</li>
      <li>Click <kbd>Return to installed styles list</kbd>, or in the left sidebar under Style Management click <kbd>Styles</kbd>.</li>
      <li>The <b>Styles</b> web page appears. Styles lists the installed phpBB board styles. The phpBB board style you just installed is added to the list of installed phpBB board styles. In this example, the prosilver Special Edition child style is added to the list indented and underneath its prosilver parent style:
       <img src='/images/install_quickinstall_windows/apc_styles_prosilver_prosilver_se_installed_783x373.gif' alt='prosilver And prosilver Special Edition Styles Installed' class='box-shadow' />
      </li>
     </ol>

     <h2><a id='selectDefaultStyle'></a>7. Select The phpBB Board Default Style For Different User Contexts</h2>

     <p>By default, installed phpBB board styles are activated. Activated phpBB board styles, not deactivated phpBB board styles, are listed as available options for selection as the phpBB board default style in the following user contexts:</p>

     <ul>
      <li>Guests (i.e., those who are not logged in). The phpBB board software allows the phpBB board Administrator to select the phpBB board default style for guests.</li>
      <li>New users (i.e., those who will register in the future). The phpBB board software allows the phpBB board Administrator to select the phpBB board default style for new users.</li>
      <li>Existing users (i.e., those who have registered). The phpBB board software allows logged in users to select a phpBB board default style for their own personal use.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>The phpBB board software provides a method for the phpBB board Administrator to select the phpBB board default style for guests and for new users, but not for existing users. Instead, the only apparent way for the phpBB board Administrator to select the phpBB board default style for existing users is an indirect, two step workaround which has the side effect of selecting the phpBB board default style for all users (i.e., guests, new users, and existing users). That this workaround selects the phpBB board default style for all users, not just for existing users, is probably of little consequence as the most likely reason for developing phpBB styles is to select them as the phpBB board default style for all users, not just for existing users.</p>
